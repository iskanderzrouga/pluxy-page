This allows you to overcome set backs of other methods, ensuring a smooth and even skin surface without the need for unwanted hair growth.

                  No! Research and dermatologists confirm, the technology in Pluxy' influences the hair growth cycle by damaging your hair follicles. By removing hair from the root, Pluxy signals your body to regenerate a new root and hair, which typically takes up to four-weeks. This repeated process weakens the follicle, resulting in thinner and finer hair regrowth.

                  It may cause discomfort at first, particularly for first-time users or those unaccustomed to waxing. The sensation, often described as a pinch, happens as you remove the hair from the root. But, many users report that this sensation diminishes over time, as hair becomes finer. Warming the skin before use and applying a soothing aloe vera product afterward can enhance comfort.

                  The device features many mechanical discs which open and close as you gently glide it over your skin. This allows them to adapt to the thickness of your hair, thick or thin, to pull it from the root - without touching your skin. The length of your session varies based on the size of the treatment area, ranging from seconds to a few minutes. This slows down hair regrowth, which can take up to four weeks, as Pluxy influences your body's natural hair growth cycle.
